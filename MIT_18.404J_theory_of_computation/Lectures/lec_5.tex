\chapter{The CF Pumping Lemma, Turing Machines}

\section{Non-context-free languages}

Based on \hyperref[theorem: CFG=PDA]{the equivalence of CFGs and PDAs}, there are some more corollaries we can see or easy to prove:

\begin{corollary}
    
\end{corollary}

Need to notice that the class of CFLs is not closed under \(\cap\) which is different from regular languages.

To prove a language is not context free, we need another tool:
\begin{example}\label{eg: 5.1}
    Let \(B = \{ 0^k 1^k 2^k | k \geq 0\} \), we will show that B is not a CFL. 
\end{example}

The tool we'll use is \textbf{Pumping Lemma for CFLs}: 
\begin{lemma}[Pumping Lemma for CFLs]

\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    
\end{proof}


Let's go back to the \hyperref[eg: 5.1](example):
\begin{example}
    
\end{example}

Another example:
\begin{example}
    Let \(F = \{ ww|w \in \Sigma^* \} \). \(\Sigma = \{ 0, 1 \} \). 
    
    Show: F is not a CFL.  
\end{example}
