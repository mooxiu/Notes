\subsection{Orthogonal Complements}

\begin{definition}[Orthogonal Complements]

    If a vector z is orthogonal to every vector in a subspace W of \(\R^n\), then z is said to be \textbf{orthogonal to} W. 
    
    The set of all vectors z that are orthogonal to W is called \textbf{orthogonal complement} of W and is denoted by \(W^{\perp}\) (and read as "W perpendicular" or simply "W perp").   
\end{definition}
